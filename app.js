    // In order to change elements on a html document 
    // it's handy to declare those elements as variables! 

    // To reference elements we can call them by their ID (single) or Class (array) name.
    // We do this with the following function: 

    let playerTypeIcon = document.getElementById("player-type-icon"); 
    // We first declared a variable. Then we called the function "getElementByID"
    // on the document that this script runs on.
    // We then specify the ID using a string. You can find which ID or Class you need by
    // looking it up in the html document. See if you can find the "player-type-icon" ID on
    // the battle.html document!
